# Tic-Tac-Toe

Simple version of tic tac toe that I built to practice python and learn pygame. 
- TicTacToe.py: Creates tic-tac-toe game and an algorithm to play against 
- pygameTicTacToe: takes the first implementation and outputs the game board with pygame (pygame doesn't handle inputs) (python 3.8)
