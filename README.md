# Tic-Tac-Toe

Simple version of tic tac toe that I built to practice python and learn basic pygame output/drawing. 
- TicTacToe.py: Creates tic-tac-toe game. Supports two person play, random computer game, and smart computer game
- pygameTicTacToe: takes the first implementation and outputs the game board with pygame (inputs not built into pygame, still takes command line inputs)
